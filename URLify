'''write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. you may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. Note: if implementing in java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place
	ex: in: "Mr John Smith     ", 13
		out: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
'''

def URLify(word):
    return word.replace(' ', '%20')
    
#not using replace
def URLify(word):
    new_string = ""
    for c in word:
        if c == ' ':
            new_string += '%20'
        else:
            new_string += c
    return new_string
