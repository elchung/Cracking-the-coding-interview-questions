'''given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. the palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words
	ex: in: Tact Coa
	output:	True: (Permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
